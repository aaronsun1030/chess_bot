# chess_bot
Minimax Chess AI.

Skeleton code for the chess heuristic competition. 

The competiton involves making the best chess heuristic for a chess AI. Everyone's will use the same AI, which uses some basic alpha beta pruning, but with a different heuristic (the part that tells how good or bad the position is).

File descriptions:
CODING
heuristic.py is an "interface" which your class should inherit from and should overwrite some of the functions of.

TESTING
game.py lets you play against the AI or have the AI play against itself.
testing.py runs your bot on a given set of tactics. The initial heuristic can already do most of them easily, so don't get your hopes up.

OTHER
rules.txt has more details on the rules of the competition (allowed practices and expectations for submission).
jenny.py is a sample submission (but not a very good one).
AI.py has the pruning logic and stuff which you don't need to worry about.
